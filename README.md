## Topic: Predicting the possibility of Wildfires in the U.S.

### Description:
* Wildfires are a huge liability to any countryâ€™s economy. It consumes houses, forests, and lives uncontrollably.
* I would like to find correlations between features such as the high temperatures in summer, forest density, winds present, latitudes and longitudes, and fire sizes. 
* Hopefully, the results would be helpful to predict the possibility of a fire before it appears, which would help the local authorities to prepare for these fires prior to the accidents.

### Initial Goals
### The feature combinations that are useful are: 
* fire_size & putout_time; fire_size & stat_cause_descr; fire_size_class & latitude & longitude.

### My Output: 
* I am hoping to predict the possibility of wildfires before they happen to help the local authorities to be prepared.

### Datasets:
* The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle, link as follows:
https://www.kaggle.com/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes 

*This is the dataset that I have used in the project*

* A second dataset is also from Kaggle, link as follows:
https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

## Part E
### New Features
* In this part, I have choosen the following features as I want to predict the magnitude of the fire based on weather conditions.

X = "Temp_pre_7","Wind_pre_7","Hum_pre_7","Prec_pre_7"

Y = "fire_size_class"

### Reason

* When I was using "fire_size" for the Y feature, I had gotten continuous value error. Hence, I changed to "fire_size_class" as suggested to using discreate values by creating buckets; which my database already has.*

## Conclusion

Alfter using many Machine Learning models for prediction and classification I have successfully understood how to predict the possibility of a fire in a particular area given the weather conditions of that place 7 days prior to the expected date. In addition to this, I have also classified the predicted fire into fire_size classes. This means the magnitude of the fire is also classified based on the data given.
