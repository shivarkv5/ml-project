# CONCLUSION NARRATIVE RESULTS

Refering to the [ANALYSIS - TECHNICAL RESULTS](https://github.com/44-599-MachineLearning-S21/project-machine-learning-s21-srkvodnala/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md) document, Linear Regression Model is better for prediction as it's RMS error is less than 50%. As for classification, Random Forest Classifier has an accuracy of 85% and precision of 88%, while the sensitivity and F1 score are around 85%.

I had also used other algorithms in hopes of getting better results. 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes for training set but the results were lower than 50%. 
- Decision Tree on training set ha given better values which were similar to Random Forest Classifier, around 80%+.
- Neural Nets algoritm had given unsatisfactory values, the accuracy and precision were aound 51% and the other metrics were below 34%.

Finally, I had to use PCA and K-Means algorithm and used Matplotlib for plotting the results graphically.

I have represented 2 features vs fire_size for clear understanding.
